# Project Description

This project is meant to be a gift. This gift is meant to be used as a self - development tool. Aside from the code, I created a physical written card where someone can write down what they are grateful for. I also 3D printed a card box which says no boundaries inside. Because, creativity knows no boundaries. Then there is a a QR code where they can scan the qr code and it'll lead them to a website where they could have the card virtually and type instead of write. I then want them have the ability to email the image to either themselves or someone. They can save the virtual card by clicking a button instead of having to take a screenshot. They can upload their cards into a database based on the date and then be able to retrieve it if they want via a link and share that link with people.

### Stretch goal

- Have a user create an account and login and then they can upload their card to a database so they can keep track of their card and so they can browse through their card and ponder over the things they've been grateful for.

# Project Roadblock

I first wanted to be able to take a picture of the physical card and then if you click on the QR code it leads you to a website where you can email your picture or have that physical card digitaly and then you can take a screenshot(Stretch goal is to be able to click a button and it saves to your computer) and attach that to an email and send it to someone. The great thing is to have the option to send the digital version or the physical version.
I tried to use OrbitCSS but it ended up making things much more complicated to style my page.
PHP took a while to learn and understand. SO I decided to go a different route. The 3D process was more difficult than I thought.
